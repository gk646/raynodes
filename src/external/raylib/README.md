# raylib (modified for raynodes)

This directory contains a stripped version of raylib, whose official website and
upstream repository are https://www.raylib.com/ and https://github.com/raysan5/raylib?tab=Zlib-1-ov-file,
respectively.

All non-build essential files have been removed, but the src directory is unchanged
